Solution to master theorem for AlgorithmsAssignemtSolution
a)T(n)= 3T(n/2)+n
solution
T(n)=Θ(nlog⁡3base2)

b)T(n)= 64T(n/8)-n^2(log n)
Solution
Master theorem cannot be applied as f(n) is not positive. 
So no solution by master theorem.

c) T(n)=2nT(n/2)+n^n
Solution
Master theorem cannot be applied as ’ a’  is not constant. Here a=2n.
So no solution by master theorem.

d) T(n)=3T(n/3)+n/2;
Solution
T(n)=Θ(n log n)

e) T(n)=7T(n/3)+n^2
Solution
T(n)=Θ(n^2)
